# COVID-19 Dashboard

## Microsoft Student Accelerator Program 2021

A PowerBI Dashboard to visualise and analyse the daily numbers of various aspects related to COVID-19.

### Data

The data for the dashboard was collected from Our World in Data and the COVID-19 surveillance dashboard of the University of Virginia.

Visualizing the COVID-19 data and analyzing it is important to understand the impact of the pandemic and to be able to make data-driven and informed response decisions. The use of the dashboard can extend to a broad range of audiences including researchers, health officials, scientists, and the general public. The dashboard will be a demonstration of all the important COVID-19 statistics to help them draw inferences from the data. It will also assist with the status update of the pandemic across the world.


### Insights

The dashboard was last updated on 07/09/2021

The dashboard aims to visualize the important elements of COVID-19 including the daily new cases, total cases, total deaths, estimated active cases, and estimated active cases. The dashboard also visualizes vaccination data including the percentage of people vaccinated at least once, fully vaccinated, and the vaccines provided by the country with the total doses administered.

The dashboard reports that the world population is 7.9 billion and 2.8% of the population has been affected by the pandemic. around 75% of the total cases acquired were recovered and less than 20% of the cases are active. More than 50% of the world population is vaccinated at least once and 40% of the world has been fully vaccinated. The most common vaccine is Pfizer. The 1-year daily cases forecasts show a steady pattern indicating the daily new cases would not go down within the period.

From this information, an insight can be drawn that the world is being vaccinated at a steady pace and yet the daily cases are predicted to be increasing. We can conclude that despite being vaccinated, rigorous actions like curfews and lockdowns should be implemented to restrict mobility and social interaction to reduce the spread of the virus. It is important to be double-dosed and isolated to quickly be able to recover.

Insights can be drawn for every country individually and be compared to see how different countries are performing against the disease. With the date filter, the data can be analyzed within the interested period.
